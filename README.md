# Spirit

Spirit is a Python framework inspired on Flask, but with easier configuration.
Spirit is specifically designed with REST in mind, and is independent of 3rd party packages.
This means that there is no specific package to deal with templates for example. The plan is to create a seperate package for Spirit which is dependend on the Jinja2 template engine.
